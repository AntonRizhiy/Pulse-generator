# Pulse-generator
Pulse generator with programmable parameters based on PsOC 4.

Over the past decade, a new direction in the design of electronic equipment has rapidly developed, namely the design of equipment in the form of systems on a chip under the PSoC (Programmable System on Chip) trademark, which contains basic components of digital microcontrollers and sufficiently efficient sets of reconfigurable digital and analog blocks.
	
This project is carried out with the aim of mastering the software implementation in C of algorithms for working with data and software and hardware components of PSoC4. Master the practical application of software and hardware components UART, timer, interrupts and digital output. Learn to receive data packets via the serial interface and analyze them ("parsing"). The work is performed using a certain variant of the AT command on 3 channels. 

This project will show the implementation of a digital device for generating periodic pulses on three outputs (channels) based on a programmable system on a PSoC4 chip.
